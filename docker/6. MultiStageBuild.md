# Multistage build
To keep images small as possible we can use multistage build. Build app package in one container and then run app in another container without build dependencies and libraries.

Result of this build will be small image only with JAVA and app.jar

## Multistage build Dockerfile example
```
FROM maven:3.5 AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY pom.xml pom.xml
RUN  mvn dependency:resolve
COPY ./src ./src
RUN mvn install

FROM openjdk:16-oracle  
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /build/target/*.jar ./app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"] 
```
