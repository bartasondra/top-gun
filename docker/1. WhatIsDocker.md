# What is Docker

## It Is a Client <-> Server Architecture
You could describe Docker as a client <-> server application. The daemon is the server, and the CLI is 1 of many clients. There’s also a number of third party clients.

You’ll find one for most popular programming languages, and you can even make your own if you want. After all, you’re just interfacing with a well defined REST API.

You can use the client to manage many different components of the daemon such as images, containers, networks and data volumes.

## Traditional Approach
- Manual configuration. 
- Setting up development environments.
- Lack of portability. 
- Inconsistent development environments.
- Too much setup complexity. 

## Docker Approach
- Declare dev environment using Docker containers. 
- Fast environment setup using Docker images.
- Consistency and standards. 
- Simplicity and choice. 
- Portability across your on-prem and cloud environments without limiting your choice of tools, frameworks, and languages.
