# Docker Daemon
The Docker daemon is a service that runs on your host operating system. It currently only runs on Linux because it depends on a number of Linux kernel features, but there are a few ways to run Docker on MacOS and Windows too.

The Docker daemon itself exposes a REST API. From here, a number of different tools can talk to the daemon through this API.
