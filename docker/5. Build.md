# Build an image

- Create Dockerfile
- Prepare your app 
- Run build command

## Create Dockerfile
Create file called Dockerfile.
Inside Dockerfile write you image prescription.
Every Docker build step (FROM, WORKDIR, COPY, RUN, ENTRYPOINT, ...) -> create docker layer. Layers are cached and best practice is to move all none changing steps on top of Dockerfile. Another good practice is to join more comands into one STEP by && operator. Images should be as small as possible and have only tools they need for run.  

### Example:
```
FROM node:latest                ->  already builded image or from scratch
USER root                       ->  build container with user root (typicaly use non-root user)
WORKDIR /app                    ->  default directory, everything is done here unless you change it  
COPY ./ ./                      ->  copy files from host into image
RUN npm install                 ->  run some commands
ENTRYPOINT ["npm", "start"]     ->  starting point
```

## Prepare your app
Prepare your application. During app development focus on controlling your app via external configs, secrets and environment variables. Best with GitOps approach and not depending on DBs. One source of truth in git in same repository. 

### Directory structure example:
```
--> App root directory
----> src directory
----> package.json
----> Dockerfile 
----> ...
```

### Dokcer build 
```
$ cd nodeApp

$ docker build -t helloWorld:1.0.0 . 
```

### Possible improvements
Change Dockerfile to first download dependencies and cache layer then copy rest app.
As long as package.json remain unchanges, docker will use cached layers and create only layers where something change and below. 
```
FROM node:latest
USER root
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./package.json ./package.json
RUN npm install
COPY ./src ./src
ENTRYPOINT ["npm", "start"] 
```
