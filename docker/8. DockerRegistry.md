# Docker registry
Act like artifact repository. Stores Docker images. 

## Usualy used docker registries:
- Artifactory
- Nexus
- GitLab
- Harbor
- Docker own registry

## Using Docker registry
Registries usualy provide some forms of authentication and authorization. To login to docker registry use command: 
```
$ docker login < dockerRegistryAddress > 
```
It will prompt you for User and Password. If login is successfull docker deamon will store your credentials in /etc/docer/daemon.json

## Using Docker registry without SSL certs
Not recomended, but sometimes you need tu run docker registry without SSL certificates.
For that docker comes with options of ```insecure registry```. Add your insecure registries to /etc/docker/daemon.json.

```
{
  "insecure-registries": [
    "http://myOwnDockerRegistry:5000"
  ]
}
```
