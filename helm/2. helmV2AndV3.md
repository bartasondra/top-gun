# Helm2 vs Helm3

## Helm2 + tiller

Helm in version 2 was used only as helm client binary (on your local machine) and it was connected to tool called `Tiller`.
At first helm have to init, by installing Tiller in to k8s cluster. After that, all comunication between your helm client and k8s cluster goes throught Tiller component.

Tiller keep tracks of all your deployments and rollbacks.

You have to add Tiller app some high security roles. Something like clusterRole=admin to allow him install or setup, all components of your application to different namaspaces.

## Helm 3

Helm in version 3 act without `Tiller` and connect directly to K8s API. Helm3 keep tracks of your deployments, by storing information in Helm secrets in k8s-namespace where you deployed your app.
