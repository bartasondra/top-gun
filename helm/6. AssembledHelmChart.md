# Assembled Helm Charts

In helm chart you can specify dependencies on other helm charts. So during the installation helm will try to install all your dependent applications along with your main application.

You can define helm chart dependencies in your Chart.yaml. Than you can store other helm charts in <your-helm-chart>/chart directory.

You can configure other helm charts from your main values.yaml or even you can write som global variables.

## Example

```
./main-app
    - charts
        - app1  (helm chart for app1)
        - app2  (helm chart for app2)
    - templates
        - helm templates (for main-app)
    - values.yaml
    - Charts.yaml
```

values.yaml

```
name: myapp
cmd: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
env: dev
image:
    name: "busybox"
    tag: "1.28"


app1:
# This will be accesible only in app1 helm chart
    image:
        name: "app1"
        tag: "v1"


app2:
# This will be accesible only in app2 helm chart
    image:
        name: "app2"
        tag: "v1"

global:
# This is accesible in all helm charts
    env: dev

```
