# k8s Nodes

Kubernetes runs your workload by placing containers into Pods to run on Nodes. A node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node contains the services necessary to run Pods, managed by the control plane.

Typically you have several nodes in a cluster; in a learning or resource-limited environment, you might have just one.

The components on a node include the kubelet, a container runtime, and the kube-proxy

### List nodes command:
```
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
```
