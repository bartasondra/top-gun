# Kubectl
The kubectl command line tool lets you control Kubernetes clusters. For configuration, kubectl looks for a file named config in the $HOME/.kube directory. 

# Kubeconfig 
Default location of kube config is $HOME/.kube directory.
You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable or by setting the --kubeconfig flag.
