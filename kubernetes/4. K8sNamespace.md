# K8s Namespaces
- Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces

### When to Use Multiple Namespaces
- Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects. For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create or think about namespaces at all. Start using namespaces when you need the features they provide.

- Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.

- Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users (via resource quota).

- It is not necessary to use multiple namespaces just to separate slightly different resources, such as different versions of the same software: use labels to distinguish resources within the same namespace.
